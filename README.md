## Presentation Requirements
* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application
How would you like to have an app that gives you instant access to relaxing images and inspiring quotes?  Take a 5 minute break and generate some lovely memes to share with friends!

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
We were tasked with developing an app that used two API's and utilized user inputs.  Our user story is "As a user I want to find a website that will give me a inspirational quote with a calming background image so I can have a quick self care break."  While browsing through the various available API's, one of our developers realized that there was a great opportunity to make an app that could be used for daily self care breaks and stress relief.  The other developers agreed that it would be a very useful product that could be shared with those that need it.

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
We found the Pixabay and Type Fit APIs to be perfect for our goal.  While utilizing these API's, we also wanted to take the opportunity presented to us to use TailwindCSS to style our app.  

We knew that Hank had a good understanding of javascript, however Dennis took the lead and wrote the initial javascript code.  Hank helped us reach the finishing line with the javascript file and managing TailwindCSS.  Laura worked on finding images, styling and citations.  We worked as a team, with one person taking teams typing the code, and the others giving input on the code.  For the last part of the project, we divided up the remaining tasks and each took on a part to work on, so we could triple our efforts for the finishing touches.  Hank worked on local storage.  Dennis worked on user experience and prompts for inputs. Laura worked on the README.  We each verbally contributed to the direction of the project while we worked on our individual parts as well.
Challenges we encountered during this project were things like learning TailwindCSS documentation, staying on task, not getting into side issues, focusing on the main goals and differences of opinions when it came to styles.

## Directions for Future Development
Things that we would like to add to this app:
We have considered a few times throughout this project, adding an HTML entry page and a "favorites" page with the top most searched descriptors.
We would love to add a music API for relaxing, peaceful music to play in the background while people interact with the GUI.
We considered having the images fade in and then quote fade in after that.  
We would also add a random button so that the user could just pull up something quickly.
We would love to add a share button for people to share their creations with the world!
