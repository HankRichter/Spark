# Grading Rubrik (for reference)

## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements

Use this [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) to address the following: 

* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for Future Development

* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
